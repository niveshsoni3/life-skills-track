## Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg

In the video, BJ Fogg shared his unique habit of doing two push-ups every time he urinates and increasing the number daily. This intriguing approach inspired him to incorporate other small, healthful routines into his day, leading to a transformation in his life. By starting with simple, enjoyable, and rewarding actions, Fogg emphasizes the importance of selecting new behaviors that one truly wants to adopt, making lasting change more achievable.

## Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg - Core Message

### The "B = MAP" Method

- **Behavior (B):** The specific action or habit you want to adopt.
- **Motivation (M):** Your reason or desire for doing the behavior.
- **Ability (A):** Your capability to perform the behavior.
- **Prompt (P):** The trigger or cue that reminds you to do the behavior.

Aligning your Behavior with Motivation, Ability, and Prompt helps make new habits easier to adopt and maintain.

### The Importance of Celebrating Success in Habit Formation

Celebrating after each successful habit completion is important because it reinforces the behavior, making it more likely to become a habit. It creates a positive association with the behavior, increases motivation, and boosts confidence, ultimately leading to long-term behavior change.

## 1% Better Everyday

The concept of "1% Better Every Day" emphasizes making small, incremental improvements in various aspects of our lives daily. It underscores the power of consistency and persistence in achieving significant progress over time through continuous, gradual growth. This idea promotes a proactive and sustainable approach to personal development, encouraging individuals to embrace the journey of self-improvement by focusing on small steps forward each day.

## Atomic Habits Perspective

### Identity in Habit Formation

In "Atomic Habits," identity is central to habit formation. James Clear emphasizes that lasting behavior change occurs when habits align with our sense of self. Changing our identity to embody the habits we desire makes behavior change more sustainable.

### Making Habits Easier

"Atomic Habits" suggests making habits easier by using "habit stacking" (linking new habits to existing ones), designing environments to promote desired behaviors, and creating implementation intentions (specific plans for when and where the behavior will occur).

### Making Habits Harder

To make habits harder, "Atomic Habits" recommends implementing "habit barriers" (creating friction and obstacles for undesired habits), using "temptation bundling" (pairing undesirable habits with enjoyable activities), and altering the environment to discourage unwanted behaviors.
